# Current State

## Purpose

This document is the live operational truth of the project. It summarizes what is documented, what is working, what is risky, and what must be built next.

## System Status

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Documentation structure | Stable | `docs/` is now the canonical source of truth. |
| Google Sheets docs | Good baseline | Sheet files, formulas, ownership, field standards, and business rules are documented. |
| n8n workflow docs | Good baseline | Four workflow exports and suite-level rules are documented. |
| Backend order docs | Good baseline | Current API behavior, known gaps, and refactor direction are documented. |
| Live order system | Needs stabilization | This is the current profit-critical area. Fix before expanding features. |
| Web app | Needs usability work | App should support operations, not create extra manual work. Focus after order structure is stable. |
| Media workflow | Disabled | `1.3` is official but must remain disabled until fixed and tested. |

## Completed Documentation Work

The following documentation areas are now usable as planning inputs:

- `docs/03-google-sheets/`: Google Sheets schema, ownership, formulas, fields, and per-sheet docs.
- `docs/04-n8n/`: n8n suite map, workflow rules, data flow, node responsibilities, protected logic, and four workflow exports.
- `docs/02-backend/`: backend API structure, order logic, data models, module structure, and refactor plan.

## Current Build Priority

The next build work should focus on **orders first**.

Reason:

- orders are live
- orders are the profit section
- incorrect order behavior can reserve the wrong pigs or block available stock
- Sam and the web app both depend on reliable backend order truth

## Known Critical Order Gaps

### Reject Releases Reserved Lines

Status: implemented and live-verified.

Confirmed behavior:

- `reject_order()` blocks completed orders from being rejected
- linked order lines become `Line_Status = Cancelled`
- linked line reservations become `Reserved_Status = Not_Reserved`
- `ORDER_MASTER.Reserved_Pig_Count` becomes `0`
- `SALES_AVAILABILITY` recovers and makes pigs available again through the formula chain
- `ORDER_STATUS_LOG` records the rejection

### Customer Cancellation Is Implemented, n8n Wiring Added, Needs Live Verification

Current backend behavior:

- `cancel_order()` provides a dedicated customer cancellation action
- `POST /api/orders/<order_id>/cancel` is available
- `Order_Status = Cancelled`
- `Approval_Status = Not_Required`
- `Payment_Status = Cancelled`
- linked non-cancelled/non-collected lines are cancelled
- linked line reservations are set to `Not_Reserved`
- `Reserved_Pig_Count` is reset to `0`
- `ORDER_STATUS_LOG` records customer cancellation when state changes

Current n8n wiring:

- `1.2 - Order Steward` has a `cancel_order` branch calling `POST /api/orders/{order_id}/cancel`
- `1.0 - Sam Sales Agent` uses `pending_action = cancel_order` for two-turn confirmation
- `CANCEL_ORDER` is evaluated before create/update routes
- stale cancel confirmation is cleared through `CLEAR_PENDING`

Remaining watch point:

- verify formula views recover availability correctly after real Google Sheets execution

### Split Requested Item Sync Needs Hardening

Known risk:

- split items such as `primary_1` and `primary_2` have not always synced correctly
- female/secondary split rows have been missing or not updated in some tests

Required behavior:

- all split item keys must be preserved
- repeated syncs must not create duplicates
- stale lines must be released/cancelled before replacement
- partial matches must not silently appear complete
- line totals must match requested quantity before Sam confirms success

### Sam Needs Safer Order Context

Approved direction:

- Sam should get order context through `1.2 - Amadeus Order Steward` and backend review actions
- direct production access to `ORDER_OVERVIEW` should not be the first choice

Reason:

- backend can verify customer/order ownership
- backend can return only safe, relevant fields
- backend responses are easier to test than uncontrolled AI sheet reads

## Web App Current Concern

The app must become useful for daily operations. It should help with:

- viewing orders clearly
- understanding reservation status
- approving/rejecting/cancelling orders safely
- releasing pigs correctly
- showing logs/history
- reducing manual debugging work

Do not focus on app polish before order behavior is correct.

## Next Decision Point

Move from documentation into implementation planning for **Phase 1: Order Lifecycle Stabilization**.
